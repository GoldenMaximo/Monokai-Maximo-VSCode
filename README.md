# Monokai Maximo

Based on the Monokai and Monokai Dark soda themes, I did some minor tweaks to make the code a bit more readable and the brackets easier to see, not much else to say.
This is mostly for personal use since I got tired of having to re-install the theme manually whenever VSCode decided to update.
